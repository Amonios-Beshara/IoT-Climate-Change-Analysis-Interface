# IoT Solution for Monitoring Sea Level Rise and TDS in Nile Delta Aquifers

## Overview
This project leverages an IoT-based system to monitor the effects of climate change, particularly rising sea levels, on the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in Egypt's Nile Delta aquifers. By using **Temperature Sensors** and **TDS Sensors**, the system continuously collects environmental data to analyze how changes in sea level and temperature can impact water quality in the Delta. Python scripts process this data and provide predictions, which are visualized on a web dashboard for easy access and decision-making.

The system aims to provide an accurate, real-time, and data-driven solution to understand the effects of climate change and to support sustainable water management strategies in the region.

## Features
- **Temperature and TDS Sensors**: Measures ocean temperature and TDS levels in water along the Nile Delta.
- **Data Analysis**: Python scripts analyze the data to forecast the impact of rising temperatures and sea levels on the water quality.
- **Web-Based Dashboard**: Visualizes real-time data with charts and graphs for easy monitoring and analysis.
- **Accurate and Low Noise Data**: High-quality data collection with minimal sensor noise for reliable analysis.
  
## Objectives
- Monitor temperature and TDS levels in real-time across the Nile Delta region.
- Analyze the effects of rising sea levels on TDS and water quality in the aquifers.
- Provide predictive insights into future climate impacts and water resource sustainability.
- Offer accurate, low-noise, and reliable data that can inform climate change mitigation strategies.

## System Components
### 1. **Temperature Sensors**
- Measure ambient and oceanic temperatures to track the rise in sea level and water temperature.
- Help analyze the correlation between temperature changes and sea level rise.

### 2. **TDS Sensors**
- Measure the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the water, indicating the level of salinization caused by rising sea levels.
- Provide real-time data on the salinity levels in the Nile Delta aquifers, which is crucial for water quality monitoring.

### 3. **Data Analysis with Python**
- The collected data is processed using Python scripts that analyze temperature and TDS changes, providing predictions about future trends in water quality and climate impacts.

### 4. **Web Interface for Visualization**
- A web-based dashboard (built using **Flask** or similar web framework) displays real-time data in graphical form, providing users with insights into temperature and TDS trends.
